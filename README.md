# geoinfotech-security-infrastructure-map
A geospatial web application that analyses, visualises and compares security exposure across Nigerian regions using adjusted risk scores, infrastructure density and accessibility factors. 
This application was developed to provide a structured, data-driven view of security exposure across different regions. The core of the system is a composite risk model that integrates crime records, security infrastructure distribution and accessibility patterns into a single interpretable index. Crime serves as the fundamental indicator because the frequency and concentration of incidents reveal the underlying threat environment. Areas with elevated crime form the baseline of higher exposure, while low-incident zones reflect comparatively reduced threat levels.

Security presence was modelled alongside this baseline because the availability, proximity and density of protection assets determine how quickly a region can receive support. The spatial relationship between each location and nearby checkpoints, police stations and military bases was quantified so the index could distinguish between places with strong coverage and those that remain underserved. Locations with limited security assets or long response distances are typically more vulnerable, even if their crime history is moderate.

Accessibility plays a similar role. Regions with good road connectivity and strong access routes allow faster movement of responders and patrol units, while isolated or hard-to-reach areas experience delayed intervention times. These patterns of land-use and transportation connectivity influence practical safety and were included to refine the exposure modelling even further.

All these factors were integrated into a composite score that reflects both the level of threat and the level of resilience in each region. Crime intensity increases the score, strong and well-distributed security presence reduces it and accessibility conditions moderate it again. A final adjustment layer was added to ensure that the index can incorporate current intelligence that may not yet be captured in static datasets. This allows analysts to account for recent events, operational changes or temporary instability and ensures that the final output reflects real-world conditions as accurately as possible.

The resulting adjusted risk score is the value displayed in the web application and it represents the most complete view of regional security exposure. It harmonises quantitative data with expert knowledge and supports practical decision-making for movement planning, field assignments and operational risk management.

The application also provides an interactive map interface where users can search, zoom and assess the relative safety of specific locations or compare two regions directly. Each comparison produces a structured PDF summary that explains the risk logic, interprets the exposure level of the selected locations and outlines which area presents a safer operational profile. The platform is designed to be intuitive, lightweight and responsive, offering a seamless user experience for teams that need fast and reliable situational intelligence.
